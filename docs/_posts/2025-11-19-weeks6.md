The sixth week I look inside the [go2 model](https://github.com/khaledgabr77/unitree_go2_ros2) repository to know how it was able to recive `cmd_vel` messages.

It is done by using the CHAMP framework to compute how the legs must move in order to move the legs in the desire way.

I have also looked at the [unitree mujoco](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_mujoco) repository, that integrates the mujoco simulator with the unitree robots
