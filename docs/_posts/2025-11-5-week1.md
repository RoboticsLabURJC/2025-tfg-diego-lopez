The first week was all about setting up the tools and programs needed to get this project started.

This **TFG** (Final Degree Project) will be developed using **ROS 2 Humble** together with **Gazebo Harmonic**. However, that combination came with a few challenges. My current operating system is **Ubuntu 24.04**, where ROS 2 Humble is no longer officially available.

After evaluating a few options — such as running a virtual machine or creating a dual-boot setup with both Ubuntu 24.04 and Ubuntu 22.04 — I decided that the most practical solution was to **use Docker**. I built a Docker container based on the official ROS 2 Humble image.  

Since the default image doesn’t include Gazebo, I had to **install it manually inside the container**. This setup allows me to keep my main system clean while ensuring full compatibility with the ROS 2 Humble environment.

### Summary

- Installed and configured Docker.  
- Created a container using the **ROS 2 Humble** image.  
- Added **Gazebo Harmonic** manually to the container.  
- Verified compatibility with **Ubuntu 24.04** host.
